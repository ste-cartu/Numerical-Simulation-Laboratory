# Exercise 01.1

## First method - one for loop
The first way I have done this exercise is to write one unique for loop to compute the blocking average for the mean and the variance, and also for the $\chi^2$.

## Second method - using classes
In this second method I computed the blocking average for the mean and the variance using the class `BlockingAverage`.

## Third method - for loop with vectors
The third way uses one single for loop to compute the blocking averages using `std::vector`, I leave it commented.
